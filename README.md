## Description

This project is a smart ambulance system that aims to provide immediate assistance to users who have fallen down due to various medical conditions. When a user falls down, their phone will display an alert for 10 seconds. If the alert is not cancelled within that time, the user's location will be sent to the server. The server will then assign an ambulance to the user's location for immediate assistance.
